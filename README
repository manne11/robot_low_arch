There are two folders: project_code and Design_doc(because of confidentiality agreement, only portions are replicated)

/**********************************DESIGN****************
project_code/Design_doc contains the design effort for designing these processes. It contains a "formal_UP_process.html" file which will show the design. A simple way to view the design is with the command:

			firefox formal_UP_process.html &

"firefox" can be replaced with other browser. Make sure that you are in the directory "Design_doc" when executing this command.

/**********************************IMPLEMENTATION********
project_code/Code will have three processes:

             //process containing the code for the translation(straight movement)
             Translation.cpp
	         |---->translation_unit.cpp
		 |---->translation_unit.hpp
		 |---->translation_unit_priv.hpp

             // process containing the code for the orientation(curved movement/IMU)
	     Orientation.cpp
	         |---->orientation_unit.cpp
		 |---->orientation_unit.hpp
		 |---->orientation_unit_priv.hpp

             // process containing the odometry algorithm
             Odometry.cpp

             // process to test the communication(prototype)
	     jitter_measure_proto.c
